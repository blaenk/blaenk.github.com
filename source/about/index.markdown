I'm Jorge Israel Peña, also known as Blaenk Denum. I'm a software developer self-taught from the age of 12 with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. I currently live in Southern California. I speak English, Spanish, and French. My areas of interest are [Artificial Intelligence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence), [Machine Learning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning), and [Digital Signal Processing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signal_processing). More specifically, I'm interested in the combination of each of these fields in the interdisciplinary science of [Music Information Retrieval](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_information_retrieval), particularly for music visualization.

I try to be pragmatic when it comes to software development. I prefer not to be opinionated with regards to any particular technology, knowing that it's constantly evolving. Instead I use what I think works best for any given situation. In this spirit, I acknowledge and defer to experience. As a testament to this mindset, my PC triple-boots Windows 8, Arch Linux, and Mac OS X Mountain Lion. I actually do use each one for different things.

Perhaps my strongest preference is when it comes to editors, in which case I absolutely love vim. In the aforementioned spirit, however, I don't go pushing it on other people. When it comes to languages, I have learned to keep an open mind such that I have no qualms when it comes to learning languages as theoric as Haskell, full of edge-cases as C++, or obscure as Erlang -- all the while striving to find qualities to appreciate in each one. I see languages as defining the operating rules of an alternate universe. If you use the language, you must accept those rules -- there's no point in complaining.

I love Electronic Dance Music, which I primarily listen to by filtering various EDM radio shows for the best tracks. Shows I listen to are Armin van Buuren's A State of Trance, Sander van Doorn's Identity, and Tiësto's Club Life.

I work out religiously, every other day, specifically doing strength training. I do squats, overhead presses, bench presses, deadlifts, and barbell rows.
