I'm Jorge Israel Peña, also known as Blaenk Denum. I'm a software developer self-taught from the age of 12 with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. I currently live in Southern California. I speak English, Spanish, and French.

My areas of interest are [Artificial Intelligence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence), [Machine Learning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning), and [Digital Signal Processing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signal_processing). More specifically, I'm interested in the combination of each of these fields in the interdisciplinary science of [Music Information Retrieval](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_information_retrieval), particularly for music visualization.

### Technology ###
I try to be a [pragmatic programmer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pragmatic_Programmer). I love to learn different technologies, most recently [Haskell and Digital Signal Processing](http://blaenkdenum.com/2013/01/04/naive-convolution-in-haskell/). I don't do it to be elitist or to jump on the latest bandwagon and be hip, but because I have a genuine interest in gaining different perspectives on software development in order to maintain an open and malleable mind. I think it'll help to prepare me for future technological disruptions.

I don't waste time with being prideful. Instead I always defer to experience, but I ensure a proper understanding instead of [cargo culting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult_programming).

I prefer to use the best tool for the job. For this reason I try to be agnostic when it comes to technologies: I'm open to any operating system, tool, language, and framework. But don't mistake this neutrality for indifference. I simply strive to appreciate the benefits of different technologies. Whenever possible, however, I prefer to use tools at which I'm already adept, such as vim, git, and a POSIX environment.

### Music ###
I love Electronic Dance Music, which I primarily listen to by filtering various EDM radio shows for the best tracks. Shows I listen to are Armin van Buuren's A State of Trance, Sander van Doorn's Identity, and Tiësto's Club Life.

### Fitness ###
I work out religiously, every other day, specifically doing strength training. I do squats, overhead presses, bench presses, deadlifts, and barbell rows.
