I am Jorge Israel Peña, also known as Blaenk Denum. I am a software developer self-taught from the age of 12 with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. I currently live in Southern California. I speak English, Spanish, and French. My areas of interest are Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Digital Signal Processing.

I try to be pragmatic when it comes to software development. I prefer not to be opinionated with regards to any particular technology, knowing that it's constantly evolving. Instead I use what works best for any given situation. In this spirit, I acknowledge and defer to experience.

That said, I do have preferences. My PC triple-boots Windows 8, Arch Linux, and Mac OS X Mountain Lion. My favorite text editor is vim. I don't really have a favorite language, though I really enjoy writing Haskell and Ruby.

I enjoy Electronic Dance Music, which I primarily listen to by filtering various EDM radio shows for the best tracks. Shows I listen to are Armin van Buuren's A State of Trance, Sander van Doorn's Identity, and Tiësto's Club Life.

I work out religiously, every other day, specifically doing strength training. I do squats, overhead presses, bench presses, deadlifts, and barbell rows.

You can find me on [github](http://github.com/blaenk) and [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/101090/jorge-israel-pena). You can also check out what I'm up to [lately](/lately).
